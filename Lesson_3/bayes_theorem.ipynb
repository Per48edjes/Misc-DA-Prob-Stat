    "Between 1996-98, Sally Clark, a British woman, lost her two infant children under similarly mysterious circumstances. The defence argued that the children had died of *SIDS* - sudden infant death syndrome. However, the prosecution claimed that the probability of children from an affluent family, like Clark's, suffering from SIDS was 1 in 73 million. They used this to *prove* that she *must* be guilty of killing her children; in 1999, Clark was, in fact, convicted of murdering them.\n",
