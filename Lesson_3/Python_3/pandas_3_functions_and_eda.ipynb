    "## The Business Problem: CRD Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of how a business partner might approach this, via **email**, **slack**, or **intake meeting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We're facing a lot of uncertainty due to changing CRDs - it's difficult or impossible to arrange origin trucking, and some of our sailing/filght assignments are being invalidated. Can we get more visibility into how often this is happening? \n",
    "\n",
    "It pays to follow up with the stakeholder here to get some context and figure out how to best approach the problem:\n",
    "1. What's the specific business risk involved? The first example above outlines this fairly well.\n",
    "2. What are the specific scenarios where we might care about this?\n",
    "3. How can this information be _actionable_ for the end user?\n",
    "\n",
    "Number (3) is especially important here - ultimately, whatever solution that you provide, it should speak to some action that the stakeholder team can take based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you ask for clarification and get the following additional information:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We're specifically interested in ocean shipments, because anecdotally it's really disrupting our fullillment process. If a CRD changes and we can't use the original assignment, then we might end up with dead inventory which has a pretty direct financial impact. It also creates a bad experience for the client, who may end up with a longer transit time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we knew how often CRDs were historically changing, we could get a sense of how much this is contributing to our overall fulfillment problems. We can start to \"score\" clients based on the likelihood that their CRDs will change, and either enforce better behavior or account for this in our fulfillment process. It would be really cool to actually _anticipate_ which CRDs will change and by how much, anecdotally this seems really unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Framing Analytical Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Great - now we have a better understanding of how the business is thinking about this problem. But where do we even start with actually pulling data?\n",
    "\n",
    "While some of the suggestions from our stakeholder might be exciting - predicting CRD changes, scoring clients - here it pays to ***challenge your assumptions, start as simple as possible, and increase complexity in a logical and incremental fashion***\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start by laying out some clearly defined questions that we should be able to answer with data:\n",
    "- How often do shipment CRDs change?\n",
    "- When CRD does change, how much on average does it differ from the original or previous CRD?\n",
    "- When do CRD changes typically occur, relative to quoting and relative to the CRD itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these should give us insight into the more general questions asked by our stakeholder (how much of a problem is this?) while also giving us a sense of how much further we can take this analysis. All of these questions can also be sliced on different dimensions, like client segment and trade-lane, to get more insight (if it's actionable).\n",
    "\n",
    "***What data points would we need to answer these basic questions?***\n",
    "- Each instance of a CRD being created or changed for a shipment\n",
    "- The time that the creation/change took place\n",
    "- The CRD at that time\n",
    "- When the shipment was quoted\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately we don't have a true event-based data table for CRDs (if this has changed, awesome). But we _can_ back out the changes from the audits table. Let's grab the data and get started."
