# 📚🐍 DA Probability & Statistics Learning Series 
[\#da_prob_stat](https://flexport.slack.com/archives/G0119CY6W56) ☞ **@Ravi2**

## Overview 👨‍🏫

This monorepo houses all of the in- and out-of-class materials for the internal Data team's L&D series on probability & statistics (in Python). The course consists of two primary tracks: a Python (🐍) track consisting of lessons about the data ecosystem in Python and a probability/statistics (📚) track that illustrates data analysis techniques and mathematical theory implemented in Python. Both tracks leverage real, Flexport data.

As of writing, we currently have the following lesson varieties:

|   | Lesson Type  | Description                        |
|---|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| 🐍  | Python     | Applied practice using Python for data analysis |
| 📚  | Prob/Stat  | Applied probability/statistics theory |
| 🤏  | Mini       | Supplemental content to serve as deeper dives or review |

## Getting Set Up 🏗
_Use the Slack channel to solicit help getting set up should you need it!_

The instructions herein assume you already have `git` + `pipenv` installed and that you have access to `github.flexport.io`.

1. Clone this repo.

2. We use `pipenv` to manage our virtual environments, so please review [the basics of Python virtual environments](https://flexport.slack.com/files/UP1Q44N20/F010LCCDFJ8/python_environments_101_for_data_analysts) first if you're unfamiliar with them. Build a virtual env in your local repo by running `pipenv sync`.

3. Run `pipenv shell` to enter your environment. Your command line prompt may change to reflect this (depending on your shell configurations).

4. You can do whatever you'd like at this point just as you could in any other repo: open a lesson (Jupyter Notebook), work on a challenge/problem on your own branch, submit PRs, etc.
